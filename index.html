                <h5 class="card-title">Project Overview</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Ciana’s goal is to prevent the marginalization of new immigrants and refugees
                    and
                    facilitate their successful integration in their new country - The need for motivated volunteers
                    is
                    integral for the success of this NGO.
                    My research findings were that the website lacks the structure and visual presence to
                    effectively
                    represent their goals and needs for those that are interested in becoming their advocates
                    through
                    volunteering or fundraising.
                    The project requires improvements to the navigation, logistics and branding of the website so
                    that
                    the users can understand the goals while easily navigating the structural interface of the site.
                    The
                    users should feel engaged, excited, and easily understand the steps they can take to become
                    volunteers or become involved in order to help with the cause and to carry out Ciana’s mission
                    in
                    helping immigrant communities through the volunteering process.

                <p class="card-text">When this project was started I made the assumption that our users were the
                    immigrants looking for legal and educational support.
                    -I chose to keep the initial survey general and have the interviewees guide us. The questions I
                    asked were definitely more focused on the immigrant community using the site - see question
                    below
                    and on graphic:
                    -What does the organization do and what is the scope of their work and if that information was
                    obvious when looking through the site.
                    -Asked our users to find out information about assistance and the types of services they offer.
                    - Asked our users to look at the process of donation and what the getting involved / volunteer
                    opportunities looked like and to describe the opportunities.
                    -My final question during my initial interview series of the users was would they recommend the
                    site
                    to new immigrants….
                    As you will see in the interview documentation we learned the assumption that the immigrants
                    were
                    the users was inaccurate.

                    -6 users felt the app was easy to use and navigate.
                    -6 users asked for the Get Involved button to be a more prominent color if the goal was to get
                    more
                    volunteer - For continuity, I used the same color buttons for Donate and Get Involved in the
                    iteration used with testers.
                    -5 users liked the simplicity of the volunteer form
                    -5 users felt the Thank you page created a sense of accomplishment
